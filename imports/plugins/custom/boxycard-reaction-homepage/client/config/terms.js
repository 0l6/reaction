    content: ` When certain words and phrases are used in these Terms and Conditions, they have specific meanings (these are known as 'defined terms'). You can identify these defined terms because they start with capital letters (even if they are not at the start of a sentence). Where a defined term is used, it has the meaning given to it in the section of the Terms and Conditions where it was defined (you can find these meanings by looking at the sentence where the defined term is included in brackets and speech marks).    When we refer to \"we\", \"us\" or \"our\", we mean TryClub Inc., Co. Where we refer to \"you\" or \"your\" we mean you, the person using the Services.    These Terms and Conditions are only available in the English language. We will not file copies of the contracts between us and you relating to our supply of the Services, or between you and the Shops relating to the sale of the items, so we recommend that you print or save a copy of these Terms and Conditions for your records (but please note that we may amend these Terms and Conditions from time to time so please check the App and the Website regularly, and each time you use the Services to order items, to ensure you understand the legal terms which apply at that time).`

    content: `The steps you need to take to place an order are explained in the \"How to Order & Try & Pay\" section of our How to Shop page.    By completing the check-out process and placing an order, you are offering to purchase the items from the relevant Shops (and not directly from us). Your order for the items is subject to these Terms and Conditions which are incorporated into the contract between you and the relevant Shops. All orders are subject to availability and confirmation of the order price.    To order items you must be over 18 years of age and possess a valid credit or debit card (please see section (c) below for details of acceptable payment methods). By placing an order, you are promising that all details you provide are true and accurate, that you are over 18 years of age, that you are an authorised user of the credit or debit card used to place your order and that there are sufficient funds in the account to cover the cost of your order.    The App and the Website allows you to check your order and correct any errors before sending it. Please take the time to read and check your order at each page of the order process as you are responsible for ensuring that the information you provide is accurate (for example, the correct items, quantities, size, colour, etc.).    (a) Formation of the contract between you and the Shop (s)    The identity of the Shop is shown on the item page of the relevant items, in your basket when the items are added and on the order confirmation page when you place an order.    When you place an order, you will receive an acknowledgement email confirming receipt of your order. This email is only an acknowledgement for information purposes and it does not constitute acceptance of your order by the Shop. The contract between you and the Shop in relation to the items will not be formed until we have checked that the Shop accepts your order. If the Shop accepts your order, we will send you an email confirming this. The confirmation email sent by us on behalf of the Shop concludes the contract with you. The confirmation email will include a description of the items included in the order and certain other information about your rights to cancel the contract between you and the Shop (please see section 10 below for further information on your rights to cancel the contract). Only those items listed in the confirmation email are included in the contract between you and the Shop.    (b) Pricing and availability Whilst we try and ensure that all details, descriptions and prices that appear on the App and the Website are accurate, as this information is provided to us by the Shops, there may be cases where errors occur. If we discover an error in the price of any items that you have ordered, we will inform you of this as soon as possible and, acting on behalf of the Shop, give you the option of reconfirming your order at the correct price or cancelling it. If we are unable to contact you, your order will be treated as cancelled. If you cancel and you have already paid for the items, you will receive a full refund.    Delivery costs are not included in the prices and will be charged in addition. The delivery costs will vary depending on the items that you have ordered and your delivery address. Please see the \"Shipping Information\" section of our Orders and Shipping page for further details of estimated delivery costs and shipping times. The delivery costs applicable to your order will be clearly displayed on the Website before you place your order (and are included in the \"Total Cost\" amount shown on the order summary page).    (c) Payment Please see the \"What payment methods does the website accept?\" section of our   FAQs for details of what payment methods can be used. When you submit your order, we carry out a standard pre-authorisation check on your payment card on behalf of the relevant Shops. Items will not be dispatched until this pre-authorisation check has been completed. For information on when your payment will be debited from your account please see the \"When will I be charged?\" section in our Orders & Shipping.    Once we have verified your payment details and the Shop has accepted and approved your order for delivery, we will email you to inform you of this. In the unlikely event that we or the Shops encounter a problem when processing your order, we will email you explaining the problem and possibly requesting further information to try and resolve the problem.    We reserve the right not to submit your order to the Shops, and the Shops reserve the right not to accept your order if, for example, the item ordered is out of stock, has been withdrawn or is otherwise not available, or if we are unable to obtain authorization for your payment or if you do not meet the eligibility criteria (e.g. you are under 18).`

If this happens, we will try and arrange for your items to be delivered as soon as possible, but we will not be liable to you for any losses caused as a result of such delay.    Delivery times may vary depending on the availability of the items and your delivery address. Delivery times are estimates only and cannot be guaranteed. The items will be delivered to you directly by the Shops so your order may be delivered in multiple deliveries.    If no one is available at your address to take delivery, our delivery partner will leave you a note and you will need to contact them to rearrange delivery.    Please also read the information on our Orders & Shipping page as this contains important information about your order and its delivery.`

    subTitle: "DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION: PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS",
    content: `Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by emailing customer support at mailto:support@tryclub.co . **In the unlikely event that our customer care team is unable to resolve a complaint you may have (or if ****TryClub**** has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration, mediation, or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.**Arbitration, which is often cheaper, faster and less formal than a lawsuit in court, uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Also, in any arbitration under this arbitration provision in which you seek less than $75,000 in damages, TryClub will pay reasonable attorneys’ fees should you prevail. TryClub will not seek attorneys’ fees from you. However, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the AAA Rules (as defined below). **Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.`

    subTitle: "ARBITRATION AGREEMENT",
    content: `TryClub and you agree to arbitrate **all disputes and claims **between us. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:    * claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;     * claims that arose before this or any prior agreements (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);     * claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and     * claims that may arise after the termination of this Terms of Service.    References to \"TryClub\", \"you\", and \"us\" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or devices under this or prior agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies, including, for example, the Federal Communications Commission. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into this Terms of Service, you and TryClub are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This Terms of Service evidences a transaction in the interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Terms of Service.    A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (\"Notice\"). The Notice to TryClub should be addressed to 2711 Centerville Road, Suite 400, Wilmington, New Castle County, Delaware 19808 (\"Notice Address\"). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\"). If TryClub and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or TryClub may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by TryClub or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or TryClub is entitled.    The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, \"AAA Rules\") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Terms of Service, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Terms of Service. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of the arbitration provision. Unless TryClub and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. TryClub will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the AAA Rules. However, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.    The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees and expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.    The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. **YOU AND ****TRYCLUB**** AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. **Further, unless both you and TryClub agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.    Notwithstanding any provision in this Terms of Service to the contrary, we agree that if TryClub makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the TryClub Web Site, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.`

    content: `These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and TryClub and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and TryClub with respect to the Service. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or third-party services, third-party content or third-party software. These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the State of Illinois without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and TryClub agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within New York, New York. The failure of TryClub to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. The section titles in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail. The Service may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Service. `
